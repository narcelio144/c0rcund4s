hydra detected a /secret folder on 80, so let's look into it...
there is a wordpress blog on the /secret, but it appears to be broken. The links point to a /vtcsec folder. CHANGE PATH WITH ECHO ON /ETC/HOSTS.
We can now proceed to bruteforce the admin/password. If we enumerate users with wpscan, we get that there is an admin user. Now we can brute force it. I used fasttrack to try and save time, and it actually worked. The combination is admin admin.
Now we can use metasploit to try and get a shell. We will use the vulnerability admin shell upload and fill in the data. ATTENTION do not mess with the exploits.
After getting the meterpreter shell, we will upgrade to an interactive shell. We can link to pentestmonkey for that. Then we are going to try to find a vulnerability on the target machine. We can use linuxprivchecker for that. We will transfer the file via netcat. 
Linuxprivchecker will find a bunch of stuff. There is a hash for user marlinspike. We can download the file and pass it through Johnny. Password is also marlinspike.
From marlinspike we can run the command sudo su with the same password to get root.
