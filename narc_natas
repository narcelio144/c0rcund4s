write-up: Apparently there is nothin on this source code, only a not showed pixel
		  <img src="files/pixel.png">
		  On checking files directory: http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/
		  It lists an `Index of /files`: pixel.png and users.txt

Nata3:

examining the source code, we get the message:  No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... 

this suggests something hidden in robots.txt, which is the file that disallows some paths from crawlers. If we navigate to /robots.txt, we see that the folder /s3cr3t is disallowed. That folder contais the user.txt file, that has the password:

natas4:Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ

--> Natas4:

We get the message:
Access disallowed. You are visiting from "" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" 
In the request headers, there is a "referer" field, that resolves to http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
so we should edit the referer to natas5 and resend the request. Then, if we go to the response field, we see the password:

Access granted. The password for natas5 is iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq


--> Natas5:

In this level, we get the message:

 Access disallowed. You are not logged in.

If we examine the response, we see a 401 (that doesn't help much) and a 200 document. Let's take a closer look.
There's a set cookie field that resolves to false (that is, = 0). We have to change that to true (that is, =1)
We can edit the request cookies, adding ;loggedin=0 to the end of the line. Now the response from the site will be:
Access granted. The password for natas6 is aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1
